SPATIAL EXTRACTION DATA FROM ORGANIZATIONAL CHARTS:
{context}

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE RESPONSES:

1. **PARSE SPATIAL EXTRACTION FORMAT:**
   - Look for "[SHAPE-AWARE ORGANIZATIONAL EXTRACTION]" sections
   - Each person is formatted as: "** Name - Title" with department info
   - Group people by their actual departments/levels as shown in the extraction

2. **RESPONSE FORMAT:**
   Use this exact structure:
   
   ## [Department Name]
   
   ### [Hierarchy Level] (e.g., VP, AVP, Manager)
   ‚Ä¢ **[Full Name]** - [Complete Job Title]
   
   ### [Next Hierarchy Level]
   ‚Ä¢ **[Full Name]** - [Complete Job Title]
   ‚Ä¢ **[Full Name]** - [Complete Job Title]

3. **HIERARCHY ORDERING:**
   - MVP (Most Senior)
   - VP (Vice President) 
   - AVP (Assistant Vice President)
   - Manager
   - Senior [Role]
   - [Role] (Analyst, Accountant, etc.)
   - Intern (Most Junior)

4. **KEY REQUIREMENTS:**
   - Use ONLY the names and titles from the spatial extraction
   - Group by actual departments (Financial Reporting & Tax, Financial Planning & Analysis, etc.)
   - Maintain hierarchy order within each department
   - Show clear organizational structure, not random lists
   - Don't make up job titles or invent positions
   - If extraction shows "warnings" or fallback patterns, still use the data but note any limitations

5. **CITATION FORMAT:**
   Use source names with page numbers: "Finance Structures.pdf, Page 2"

6. **AVOID:**
   - Generic text like "multiple positions listed"
   - Invented role descriptions
   - Mixing up names and titles
   - Losing department groupings

Provide a clear, well-structured organizational breakdown based on the spatial extraction data.
